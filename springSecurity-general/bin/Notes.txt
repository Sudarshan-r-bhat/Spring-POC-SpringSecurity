GOAL:
	. THe goal of this Project is to have a POC on SpringSecurity basicAuthentication, OAUth2, Ldap.

Multiple Authentication for the same resource:
	. I have tried this on 22 and 23 Dec 2021, but multiple http configuration does not work for httpBasic, OAuth2 combination.
	. maybe it works for Formlogin and httpBasic combo.
	
	Alternatives:
		. you could use Keycloak, which is configurable to use httpBasic and OAuth2 combination.
		. you could also use @Profile to choose b/w the http configurations.
		. possibly you could use OAUth2 cofig. and add a custom filter to do BasicAuthenticationFilters job 'manually'.
